# Diabetes Prediction
This is my portofolio about diabetes predicition. I used dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. 

* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* nsulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
*DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
